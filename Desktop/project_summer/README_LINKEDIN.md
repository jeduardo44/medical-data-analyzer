### Clinical Analysis Example:
```json
{
  "summary": "Patient shows elevated glucose levels with family history of diabetes",
  "key_findings": [
    "HbA1c: 7.2% (elevated)",
    "Fasting glucose: 140 mg/dL",
    "BMI: 28.5 (overweight)"
  ],
  "risk_factors": [
    "Family history of Type 2 diabetes",
    "Sedentary lifestyle",
    "Age factor (45+ years)"
  ],
  "confidence_score": 0.87,
  "critical_alerts": [
    "Schedule endocrinologist consultation"
  ]
}
```

### Disease Prediction Example:
```json
{
  "disease": "Type 2 Diabetes",
  "prediction": "High Risk",
